# Healthcare Dataset Analysis – Tableau Project

## Objective

The Healthcare Dataset Analysis Project focuses on exploring research funding, disease prevalence, and mortality data from 2008–2024. It demonstrates Tableau’s analytical and visualization capabilities through interactive dashboards, advanced calculations, and trend analysis.

## Scope of Work

* Analyze research funding trends across years and disease areas.
* Visualize geographic and categorical funding distributions.
* Compare funding and mortality/prevalence relationships.
* Apply Tableau functions (joins, filters, calculated fields, trend models) for in-depth analysis.
* Build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard combining multiple insights.

## Key Objectives & Insights

1. **Trend Analysis:** Identify long-term funding patterns using line charts.
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Compare research areas through bar and pie charts.
3. **Funding Allocation:** Track year-wise and category-wise funding using Gantt and stacked bars.
4. **Geographical Insights:** Visualize funding distribution via symbol and filled maps.
5. **Hierarchical Analysis:** Represent data using tree maps and heat maps.
6. **Advanced Analytics:** Correlate funding with mortality/prevalence using scatter plots and trend models.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Data Visualization Tool:** Tableau
* **Techniques Used:** Custom SQL, filters, calculated fields, trend models (linear, exponential, polynomial), and advanced charts
* **Data Range:** 2008–2024 healthcare research funding and 2019 mortality/prevalence

## Deliverables

* **Healthcare analysis-Tableau.twbx**-A packaged Tableau workbook containing all visualizations, charts, and interactive dashboards built for the project.
* **Healthcare analysis report-Tableau.ppt**-A presentation-style summary of key dashboards and visual insights extracted from Tableau for easy review and sharing.
